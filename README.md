# Dgymbook--Assignment
Objective
The goal of this assignment is to build a simple Wordle-like game using React to evaluate your skills in structuring a React application, managing state, and effectively implementing UI interactions. The key objectives include demonstrating your capability to build complex game logic, user interface design, and state management while maintaining a clean and modular codebase.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Project Setup and Initialization
Set Up the Project Directory:

Create a new directory for your project.
Navigate to your project directory using the terminal.
Initialize the Project:

Initialize a new React project using create-react-app:
npx create-react-app wordle-clone
Alternatively, if you are using Next.js, initialize a new Next.js project:
npx create-next-app wordle-clone
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory:
cd wordle-clone
Install required dependencies, if any are necessary beyond the default React setup (e.g., TailwindCSS):
npm install tailwindcss
Development Process
Game Logic:

Define the Core Logic:

Establish a hardcoded list of 5-letter words.
Define the rules for processing guesses.
Implement a function to check if a guessed word matches the target word.
Feedback Mechanism:

Create a feedback system that returns color codes:
Green for correct letters in the correct position.
Yellow for correct letters in the wrong position.
Gray for incorrect letters.
Guess Validation:

Ensure that only valid words can be submitted.
User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX):

Grid Display:

Design a grid to display previous guesses with color-coded feedback.
Game Status Message:

Implement messages for the user, indicating whether they have won or lost the game.
New Game Functionality:

Provide a “New Game” button that resets the game state.
State Management:

Manage Game State:

Track guessed words, remaining attempts, and the current status of the game.
State Updates:

Ensure the UI updates correctly based on the game state changes.
Performance and Code Quality:

Code Quality:

Write clean, modular, and readable code.
Component Structure:

Use an appropriate and efficient component structure to manage the UI and logic.
Styling and Design
Implementing CSS or TailwindCSS:

Choose a styling approach (CSS or TailwindCSS).

Implement styles for the grid display, game status messages, and game controls.

Responsive Design:

Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Optional Enhancements:

Animations:

Add animations for letter feedback to enhance user experience.
Dark Mode Toggle:

Implement a dark mode option that users can toggle.
Deployment
Prepare for Deployment:

Build the project for production:
npm run build
Deploy to a Suitable Platform:

Choose a platform for deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

Vercel:

Login to Vercel and link your GitHub repository containing the project.
Deploy the project by following Vercel’s guided steps.
Netlify:

Login to Netlify and drag your build folder to deploy or link your GitHub repository.
Configure Environment:

Ensure any necessary environment variables are configured.
Submission Guidelines
GitHub Repository:

Push your project to a GitHub repository.
Include a README.md file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
Documentation:

The README should include:
A brief description of the project.
Steps to run the project.
Any additional features or enhancements implemented.
Responsiveness:

Verify that the app works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices before submission.
End of the document.
